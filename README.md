# goodbuy *(GH Stackathon Project)*


Are you looking for a new way to make positive change? Do you hate supporting Amazon but love the convenience of their website? 

Introducing goodbuy, the Chrome Extension that monitors your online shopping. If you're browsing a website whose practices just don't cut it, goodbuy reminds you to shop ethical. 
When you click on a product to view, you'll see a notification on your goodbuy icon. Click the icon to see a list of similar products that can be purchased from a store you'd feel more confident supporting. 
Stores are categorized based on tags, which include Black Owned Business, Women Owned Business, Organic, Fair Trade, Sustainable, and Small Business. After clicking on the goodbuy icon and viewing the popup with suggested matches, you'll be able to click on any of the products to be redirected to the company's store.


goodbuy is only functional on Amazon at this stage, but will eventually work on a list of sites that have a history of workers' rights violations, racist/bigoted leadership, or any other number of bad practices. 
It's also currently only able to provide product matches based on a set of dummy data, so the next step of this project will be to integrate a web scraping software to pull product data from the list of 'good stores' and compile it into a backend database. 
Another future goal for this project is to implement a user login or Chrome Sync to access the user's location, and provide nearby business options that also sell a similar product, to encourage shopping local and reducing the footprint of online deliveries.
